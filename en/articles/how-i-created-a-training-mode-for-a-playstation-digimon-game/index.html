       <p><em>Digimon Rumble Arena</em>, originally known as <em>Digimon Tamers - Battle Evolution</em>, is a late PlayStation game that came out between 2001 and 2003, depending on the region where you lived. It is a pretty straightforward platform fighting game with traditional health bar mechanics, simple controls and some more "casual" mechanics, like items, stage hazards and power-ups. The game features 23 characters from the first three seasons of the <em>Digimon </em>anime (up to <em>Tamers</em>), plus one original character created for the game - the arcade boss, <em>Reapermon </em>(or, in Japan, <em>Gokumon</em>).</p></div>

       <p>I played this game a lot, when it came out. I, my brother, and a friend of us spent countless afternoons fighting against each other, banning <em>Seraphimon </em>(yes, we were that scrubby and my brother was too good at using him) and sometimes even organizing some minor tourneys (one of which I shamelessly, lamely won using <em>Patamon</em>'s "running the timer" tactics in <em>Reapermon</em>'s stage).</p><p>Eighteen years later, in my adult age, I have found a way to play this game again online, using the <u><a href="https://mednafen.github.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Mednafen</a></u> emulator and its built-in netplay routine. Thanks to this, I came in touch with a still active player community that holds local tourneys in Japan and New Zealand, showcasing some of the sickest combos I have ever seen done in that game (including some I wasn't even aware were possible).</p><p>Out of excitement, I booted up the game again and decided to test something myself, with my old main, <em>Stingmon</em>. I heard about an elusive "infinite loop" involving his standing melee attack, and couldn't wait to try it out. Except, the game had no training mode. Thus, I booted up a 2 players session and moved both characters to a corner, where I started trying out the combo.</p></div>

       <p>Surprisingly, it went down extremely smoothly. The combo counter went up, the health went down, and I was happy to have found a (circumstantial) 0-to-death combo, so I excitedly posted it in the <u><a href="https://discord.gg/DTpRqwd" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">community Discord server</a></u>. Only to be told that "the in-game combo counter doesn't really work"<strong> </strong>and that my infinite loop could "actually be blocked after the second hit<em>"</em> but <strong>could </strong>become a <strong>real </strong>infinite with a very precise timing. I spare you the swearing.</p><p>I booted up the game and headed for 2 Player mode <strong>again</strong>, with an awkward setup that allowed me to make the dummy block while pressing a button while, with the other hand, I was practicing my timing. Not the best solution, completely impractical, a lot of save states involved. That was the last straw.</p></div>

       <p>I am a physicist, I solve problems. And my problem was practicing a Stingmon infinite in a 18 years old game for a 25 years old console.</p><p>My first gut reaction was to do what every sane, grown up, 30 years old man would have done in my place: booting up Visual Studio 2019 to build a C++ program that would send keyboard presses to Mednafen to "simulate" the dummy blocking, without me having to do anything on my joypad. While the idea was sound and seemed to work properly in theory (opening Notepad to test and seeing the keys being sent with the rhythm I wanted), <strong>in practice</strong><em> </em>mednafen would completely disregard my program and laugh at me for my puny attempt at steering it.</p><p>It wasn't a simple accident.

       <p>It turns out, RAM address reverse engineering, at least for fighting games, is not as painful as it looks at first, as you can quickly make out many of the values you need. You are looking for the timer? Check for a value which keeps going down every frame, all things being equal. You are looking for a health value? Perform a search after every hit and compare the values in RAM with their previous one, until you find the one which keeps going down only after you hit the opponent.</p><p>There is a certain logic and beauty in all of this.</p><p>Thus, with the genuine naivete of a starry-eyed beginner, I directed all my efforts at finding those values. I selected <em>Gatomon </em>and <em>Agumon</em>, chose one of the least annoying stages (trust me, you don't want to do any of this at <em>Recycling </em>or <em>Revolution</em>), and booted my memory watcher. In a couple minutes, I could find two promising values, going down from 120 to 0, in tandem with the characters' health bars. I thought I hit a sweet spot, saved those addresses and changed the stage to confirm my findings. The values didn't move. Boom, Jackpot! Then, I performed the last test: changing characters. And that's when my world fell, broken in a dusty shower of debris.</p><p>What I expected to find: a value between 0 and 120.</p><p>What I <strong>really </strong>found: random gibberish that could probably summon <em>Cthulhu </em>or another <em>Great Old One</em> if read inverted, in front of a mirror, for three times in a row.</p></div>

       <p>As I completed the script for the basic moves, I decided to add a second function to force the dummy to perform a specific movement, be it walk, dash, jump, or other amenities.

I didn't have access to the position values, thus it was to be expected. But it was annoying. <strong>Very </strong>annoying. Worse, it was borderline useless, in its current state, with the opponent character going steadily, stubbornly in one given direction, with utter disregard for the player.

       <p>Yes, I didn't realize it at first, but this was proof that my conjecture held: if the fourth equation could be built by using the other three, that meant that <strong>the system had infinite solutions</strong>, no matter which value I chose for the offset. Normally, if you have a system with one redundant equation, the system is either impossible or has infinite solutions.</p><p>This one fell in the second category, and <strong>literally </strong>meant that I couldn't care less about the value of <strong>a</strong>, thus I just set it to 0. This effectively moved half the value of <strong>a</strong>, whatever it was, inside the other variables, making the system solvable for the new variables. Moreover, I didn't need a system of equations anymore: a single mirror match could yield the correct value for each character, because the equation would simply become <em>2</em><strong><em>x</em></strong><em> = address</em>. Thus, I only needed to get the block size for a character once to be able to cover <strong>any </strong>match up involving that character.</p><p>To test if my theory was <strong>really </strong>sound, I booted up one mirror match with <em>Renamon</em>, calculated the value, then summed it to the value I retrieved for <em>Gatomon</em>, crossed my fingers and noted down the resulting memory address. Then, I started a <em>Renamon </em>vs <em>Gatomon </em>match, and watched the previously calculated value at the start of the match.</p>	</div>

Boom, headshot! I frantically went back to the memory watcher and found out that the value for player 2 was always 132 bytes far from the address of the first player. The values of the Digi bar (the super meter of the game) followed a similar pattern.</p><p>Now, I just needed to play 19 mirror matches to retrieve the missing values. I started with <em>BlackWarGreymon</em>. Then, <em>Wormon</em>, the character with the lowest defence score in the game, according to the community. Then, <em>WarGreymon</em>.</p><p>I set up my test script, showed the life bars as percentage numbers, charged my super with both <em>WarGreymons </em>and performed it on a happy-go-lucky, blissfully unaware <em>Wormon</em>.</p><p><em>Terra Force</em> dealt a devastating 52% damage burst that made the screen tremble.

       <p>Okay, before you start calling the police to get me locked into a psychiatric hospital, I am <strong>not </strong>talking about a tiny, yellow-feathered bird. I had three canaries in my life, <em>Titti</em>, <em>Ozio </em>and <em>Kimi</em>, but this isn't about them. You know the saying "a canary in a coal mine" as a marker for signs of imminent danger? <strong>That </strong>was the canary I was talking about: an unrelated object that changed its state only when or just as the other character was hit. </p>	</div>

	<div class="magazine__text">
       <p>I thought about two or three possibilities, the first one being "the life bar size", the second being "the Digi bar size". Possibility #1 had a huge drawback: when the lifebars were frozen by the script, it couldn't possibly work. Possibility #2 had a similar, yet unrelated, drawback: the Digi bar has a maximum cap, above which it doesn't increase anymore. This made me think about possibility #3: <strong>the score</strong>.</p><p>You see, in this game every move has an associated score to it, which is awarded if it connects with the opponent and it's not blocked. The score of the attacking player increases as their moves deal damage to the opponent. Coincidentally, the addresses of the scores were among the few addresses that were completely character-independent, and I had already found them by chance during one of my previous dives.</p><p>I added an option to the script to trigger the desired action when the score of player 1 increased, crossed my fingers, and loaded it into the game.</p></div>

       <p>As the dummy blocked the third hit of my supposed <em>Stingmon </em>infinite, my heart raced with joy and profound sadness.</p><p>Joy, because I had finally solved the problem that set everything in motion and built a fully functional training mode for an old emulated PlayStation game.</p><p>Profound sadness because, as it turned out, I was far from being able to loop that jab more than twice in a row, with my current training.</p></div>
