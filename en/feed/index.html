      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>It all started with Koihime Musou: an eroge/tactical game series which revisits the legend of the 3 kingdoms of China, except the characters were all turned into waifus. Do not be fooled by Koihime Enbus's chara-designs or its artistic direction! Wrongly considered an airdasher, it is a ground-based fighting game, all about footsies, and more subtle than it may seem. If you have never tried playing it, we recommend you give it a go.</p>
<p>Not only the game's gameplay can come off as surprising, its technical aspect too, indeed Koihime Enbu has under 2 frames of input lag: this is the best score recorded on <a href="https://twitter.com/WydD/status/1099314441030696962">WydD&#039;s scale</a>, and it is even more remarkable considering it is the first fighting game ever produced by Unknown Games' mysterious team. Degica, the game's editor, had already made <a href="https://youtu.be/piNb20Ge8Aw">an interview</a> towards the end of 2017 where we could learn about how carefully the game was crafted and the philosophy behind its gameplay: the need for players to have fun right off the bat, and the will of making it different from traditional 2D fighters. We still had a few questions in mind, so we sent them over to Nakamura-san.</p>
<figure><img alt="" src="/media/pages/articles/koihime-enbu/9ac35633b7-1701364373/kouhei-nakamura.png"></figure>
<p><strong>What can you tell us about Unknown Games' history? Since when does the studio exist, who are the members of this studio?</strong></p>
<p>We ended up forming Unknown Games specifically so we could develop Koihime Enbu. However, most of our staff are illustrators; only a handful work on Koihime Enbu.</p>
<p><strong>What prompted you to make a fighting game, and why did you choose to adapt Koihime Musou?</strong></p>
<p>It all begin when we were asked to create a fighting game featuring Koihime Musou's characters. At first we were told to do whatever we wanted in terms of game design. As the game's development was making progress, we got numerous requests to make it more in line with other fighting games, to add airdashes, to make combos more spectacular. I could feel that if we were to take that direction, it would put us in direct competition with other similar titles. So, I looked at Virtua Fighter, a game I admire, to look for inspiration. I decided to make the gameplay more ground-based, with an emphasis on frame data to set a back-and-forth pace between the two players.</p>
<figure><img alt="" src="/media/pages/articles/koihime-enbu/1df19c7c37-1701364373/koihime-enbu-choryo-ryofu.jpg"></figure>
<p>In many 2D fighters, you can block an attack and still be at a disadvantage. We wanted to remove that aspect so that the players could get into the strategic scope of the game more easily. We did that by simplifying things: if your move hits the opponent, you are at an advantage, if it gets blocked, the opponent gets the upper hand.</p>
<p>By doing this, we took down many of the barriers to entry that other fighting games have, specifically, having to learn mechanics which are unique to each game. We made sure that some fighting game rules were respected: for instance, you can't get grabbed while you're airborne, backdashes have invulnerability frames. That way, a new player can jump right into the action et and experience the game's unique pace immediately.</p>
<figure class="video"><iframe allow="fullscreen" allowfullscreen src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/20Dc-Cb2ATc"></iframe></figure>
<p><strong>Which engine did you use to make the game, and why?</strong></p>
<p>We used our own engine. There is no particular reason for this decision, but it allowed us to learn how to build a fighting game from the ground up. During the development stage, we studied numerous fighting games, frame by frame.</p>
<p><strong>The game features less than 2 frames of input lag. That is impressive, especially for a first fighting game. How did you manage to do it?</strong></p>
<p>I made it a rule for myself that an action should begin on the following frame after a button is pressed. There is no particular technology behind this. The fact that we are not using real-time 3D is certainly a contributing factor. Another thing which might have played a rôle would be simultaneous button presses: if you allow for a slight delay between registering inputs, it can lead to some latency and that is why we preferred using more buttons.</p>
<p><strong>Koihime Enbu Ryo Rai Rai just came out. Are you satisfied with how people play this new version of the game?</strong></p>
<p>When a game gets updated, or whenever a sequel comes out, the gameplay changes you tend to lose long-time players. With Koihime Enbu, I tried to stay true to the core gameplay with every update or extra feature. That means some updates may not seem very exciting; however it also means that even if a player were to drop the game and come back after a few updates, they won't be left feeling like the entire game has changed.</p>

      <title>Daija Vu, I&#039;ve Just Been In This Place Before</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Created in 2014, Nacon is Bigben's new gaming division. The endgame for this French veteran in accessory-making is to get rid of their reputation as a low-quality brand and find their way next to Razer and the other big boys. Or, as they put it: “to offer <strong>players</strong> the tools to become <strong>gamers</strong> through a full range of quality gear”. Just that.</p>
<p>Let's remind everyone that a good arcade stick, in other words a sturdy case, quality stick and buttons, can be found for about 100€. Beyond that, one will sometimes pay for extra comfort, options, or just the price for the brand or logo. For 200€, the Daija sits between the very popular Hori Real Arcade Pro and the next tier, represented by the Razer Panthera.</p>
<p>From a format standpoint, it is very similar to the Panthera with 38x26x7,5cm and 3,7kg (instead of 3,5kg for its Razer counterpart). As opposed to what the promotional pictures would lead you to believe, the case is not gray/purplish, but in fact made of black plastic. The whole thing is pleasantly heavy and stable; the case lightly muffles the sound produced by pressing buttons, just enough to accentuate the impression of sturdiness the stick gives off.</p>
<figure><img alt="" src="/media/pages/articles/test-nacon-daija/acfd7986a9-1701364373/vue-complete-nacon-daija.png"></figure>
<p>The entire underside is covered in a rubber non-slip mat, way healthier and easier to clean up compared to a foam mat. Both buttons and stick are branded Sanwa, the most obvious solution to satisfy most European players. The 3m long USB cord is attached to the case, with its own storage compartment. Lastly, a headphone jack is located in a small recess at the front of the arcade stick. The Daija is compatible for PS3, PS4 and PC.</p>
<p>The layout, however, can come off as surprising. The positioning of the first two LP and LK buttons is similar to that of a Noir layout, while the other six are aligned the Vewlix way. We end up with the LP button being really far from his buddies. Once you get over the initial surprise, the buttons feel right to handle and the whole thing is still more comfortable than the usual Vewlix – which, by the way, has become the norm even though it has not been accepted unanimously. The upper plate also features a sort of wrist rest, a wide strip of plastic on which your hands can slide smoothly. While it isn't a deciding factor by any means, it feels surprisingly comfortable, and for those of you who dislike the somewhat sticky aspect of acrylic, you might want to give this a try.</p>
<figure><img alt="" src="/media/pages/articles/test-nacon-daija/dd3e1f6d1c-1701364373/layout-nacon-daija.png"></figure>
<p>The function buttons are spread on the right side of the stick. They stick out only slightly and need to be pressed pretty hard to trigger, which reduces the risks of an accident, despite the lack of a safety lock. The issue mainly comes from the two red buttons which allow you to open the stick's cover. Those do stick out a lot, and it takes time getting used to not pressing them by accident. You eventually get used to it but it's not that great in a bag, it is the kind of detail that we would like to see changed for the next model (just an idea, but what about sliders instead of buttons?). It's a real shame when you take into consideration the fact that having two locks on your cover, one on each side, is pretty valuable. The upper panel does not move in the slightest, you can hammer buttons or stick without worry (I know what you're thinking, it is something we all do): the Daija takes it like a champ.</p>
<figure><img alt="" src="/media/pages/articles/test-nacon-daija/0ac6843250-1701364373/nacon-daija-boutons-cote.jpg"></figure>
<p>Once opened, the inside is tidy and cables are hidden behind plastic covers. The hinges are reliable; that's great since one of Daija's assets is being easy to tinker, so you want to be able to leave it open without any issues. In a compartment, you can find a wrench, meant to wedge the joystick's shaft and unscrew the balltop, and a battop if you want to replace it, as well as a screwdriver which allows you to remove the upper panel's acrylic. To get access to the PCB, also located beneath a plastic cover, you need to remove 4 screws hidden behind stickers, which certainly voids the warranty. There is enough room to replace the circuit by a Brook UFB for instance, a pretty valuable feature considering this stick is meant for the PS4, a console in its twilight years.</p>
<figure><img alt="" src="/media/pages/articles/test-nacon-daija/ea538dc6d8-1701364373/nacon-daija-interieur.jpg"></figure>
<figure><img alt="" src="/media/pages/articles/test-nacon-daija/1b42efc986-1701364373/nacon-daija-pcb.jpg"></figure>
<p>On the upper panel, the acrylic is very easy to remove, with a similar system to that of the Madcatz TE2+: the plate holes are wider than the buttons. As a matter of fact, you only need to unscrew the 6 screws which hold the acrylic down as well as the joystick's balltop in order to release and replace the artwork. Just like with the TE2+, to make up for the fact that the acrylic is placed around the buttons and not underneath, the buttons are all elevated thanks to a circle of plastic. That way, the buttons end up at the proper height.</p>
<figure><img alt="" src="/media/pages/articles/test-nacon-daija/32e2214ffc-1701364373/nacon-daija-zoom-plexi.jpg"></figure>
<figure><img alt="" src="/media/pages/articles/test-nacon-daija/0011732fed-1701364373/nacon-daija-zoom-rondelle-plexi.jpg"></figure>
<p>While replacing the artwork or buttons is very simple, advanced modding options can quickly get complicated. The upper plate is composed of a metallic plate and a layer of plastic. That means widening the gap to make it fit a Fanta stick involves a lot of work. Not that big of a deal considering these modifications are very rare, especially among western players. However, leaving a wide enough opening in the plastic layer to only have to pierce or replace the metallic plate would have been much appreciated.</p>
<p>Bigger issue though, a screw and its notch are located very close to the Sanwa stick's mounting plate. While tinkering it to fit a Seimitsu plate is possible, the larger Hori Hayabusa plate will hardly fit. Once again, not every player would want to replace their Sanwa joystick; but on a sturdy stick of such quality, we would have preferred a little more flexibility to modify it over the years. We do know that the Victrix - which is supposed to be one of 2019's most promising sticks - suffers <a href="https://youtu.be/8K-S0_meddI?t=564">from a similar issue</a>. As the supply in quality amateur or professional levers is bigger than ever, this design choice from arcade stick manufacturers is a little disappointing.</p>
<figure><img alt="" src="/media/pages/articles/test-nacon-daija/824040d158-1701364373/nacon-daija-vis-genante.jpg"></figure>
<p>Despite some youthful mistakes, the Nacon Daija establishes itself as a solid option. Be careful though not to confuse sobriety with cheesy. This arcade stick does its job, and it does it well, without throwing out big words like <strong>“GEEK”</strong> or <strong>“BOOBS”</strong>. While 200€ is definitely quite a lot of money, it should be noted that the Daija's characteristics put it on a price range of about 250€. If you are a beginner looking to invest on the long term or a veteran searching for a new partner, you can go ahead without worry. Whether the Daija makes a <strong>Gamer</strong> of you is uncertain, but as a BigBen product, it has nothing to do with your little brother's controller.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>[{"content":{"text":"<p>When I started this blog, one of my goals was to talk about why \u201cE-Sports\u201d (Which here means globalized, professional competition using video games) was often incongruous with the style and principles of the greater fighting game community. The money was nice, sure, but it always came with strings attached and a sense of homogeneity that I didn\u2019t think would be accepted very well by the fairly diverse FGC. Flash forward about a year, and now I see that perhaps I was looking at it the wrong way. E-Sports is not a frightening concept on its own at all \u2013 large payouts for winning tournaments that are broadcast in arenas worldwide and streamed to hundreds of thousands, if not millions, at home? That\u2019s rad! Paying people to help run a professional broadcast and commentate the action? Tubular!&lt;\/p&gt;<p>Looking back at all the writing I\u2019ve done, there were a few recurring topics that seemed to capture the crux of my frustration with E-Sports. Chiefly, I have realized that what I have come to loathe the most is the fact that the current model for E-Sports is bolstered by a deeply conservative mindset, not unlike the mindset that has set back equality in the US for decades. This system of beliefs has a firm commitment to enforcing inequality and privilege by establishing a hierarchy amongst the player base with the sole goal of having certain people make a lot of money, and the rest staying subordinate by supporting their money-making endeavors with little to no opportunity to find the same level of success themselves. I used to be confident that the FGC would reject it, especially since it goes against most of its proclaimed principles, but looking back, this model has been slowly creeping into the status quo for a long time. The modern-day FGC has inherited some of the worst parts of political conservatism found not only in larger E-Sports initiatives, but internet culture as well. In my efforts to stamp out the roots of what I find to be a tainted cause, I will explore these conservative connections in a new series I\u2019d like to call \u201cPolitically Incorrect.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;<p>Before I start, there will probably be people who will read this and say \u201cLOL ppl will bring politics into everything nowadays\u201d and call me names that imply I am less of a man than they are like \u201ccuck\u201d or \u201cbeta,\u201d and that\u2019s fine. I will be happy to direct them to the &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/dictionary\/politics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"&gt;Merriam-Webster Dictionary&lt;\/a&gt;\u2019s definition of politics, which states it as \u201cthe total complex of relations between people living in society.\u201d We live in a society (lol) and our everyday lives are pretty much defined by our relations with others, so yeah, you better believe personal politics come into play here, there, and everywhere.

To date, I think the largest example of how much conservatism has come to the FGC\u2019s table has to be the way most major events revolve around the Capcom Pro Tour tournament series. On paper, the tour sounds good: Street Fighter V, the tournament series\u2019 sole focus, is probably the most popular game in the scene or close to it, and everyone who enters these open-bracket tournaments not only has a shot at the prestige of winning these events, but a chance to win even bigger money down the line. The Capcom Cup Finals were usually good for a look at players that had maybe made a splash here or there but had yet to break through, such as Saul \u201cMenaRD\u201d Mena, who came out of the smaller Dominican Republic scene and managed to qualify and win big in 2017.&lt;\/p&gt;"},"id":"2f5ae5b9-75a6-48ef-989d-e80cddb97ceb","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"imagelarge":["capcom-cup-2017-results-menard-check-768x433.jpg"],"figcaption":"Menard receiving his 250 000 dollars check after his victory at the 2017 Capcom Cup. \u00a9Capcom"},"id":"b643a577-57bf-47fe-b3ea-f27a512584ec","isHidden":false,"type":"imglarge"},{"content":{"text":"<p>It always had its problems, but I would say, for a while, the Capcom Pro Tour did an effective job of establishing a \u201cworld warrior\u201d theme with its global reach and mostly open-tournament format.

The doujin aims to create content referencing but also diverging from an intellectual property, sometimes without licensing."},"id":"e2363867-703a-4960-b02a-269613d8201b","isHidden":false,"type":"imgleft"},{"content":{"text":"<p>One need look no further to understand why Narita is acting so cautiously.

While some of them sell original productions, others take advantage of this opportunity to sell doujin creations of their favorite series. Unofficial scenarios and illustrations (sometimes involving radical changes in the type of narrative or visual style) are common adaptations that we can still find up to this day.&lt;\/p&gt;<p>According to Otaku culture specialist Aur\u00e9lien \"KuramaTengu\" Laureau, <em>\"the second boom of doujin took place at the beginning of the 80s, between 1982 and 1984.\"&lt;\/em&gt; Laureau says it\u2019s<em> \"the arrival of female artists doing more or less erotic adaptations of works from the nekketsu genre who started it.

Some even adjusted their works to make it easier to create doujins from it.\" &lt;\/em&gt;KuramaTengu explains. This commercial recipe also appeared in fighting games. The arrival of Sakura in Street Fighter Alpha 2 and the creation of Lilith, a younger spiritual clone of Morrigan in the Vampire series, demonstrated the desire to please an audience demanding different but referential content. <em>\"You rub your fans up the right way\"&lt;\/em&gt; summed up KuramaTengu.&lt;\/p&gt;"},"id":"960d1978-5c2e-4fa5-bab2-296e4bacd13b","isHidden":false,"type":"imgright"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Watanabe Productions is indeed not an isolated case, but a product of a time which has seen the birth of many others.

This project came to be none other than the MELTY BLOOD series.&lt;\/p&gt;<p><em>\"When creating MELTY BLOOD, we decided to do things properly.\"&lt;\/em&gt; Narita recalls. MELTY BLOOD is the adaptation of a visual novel named Tsukihime, a text-based adventure game with multiple choices.

The complete game lasts between 70 and 80 hours for a total of 4 hours of pornographic scenes.\u201d&lt;\/em&gt; Thus Tsukihime has the appearance and commercial circuit of an amateur game, but the stature and content of a professional product. It was created by only four people and has been a tremendous success. <em>\"They sold the most copies during the 2001 Comiket.

At the time TYPE-MOON was still an amateur circle but in the process of professionalization and they liked the proposal, they approved it.\"&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;<p>The development was launched in 2000, without any funding. <em>\"We made the game as amateurs on our free time\"&lt;\/em&gt;, laughs Narita. But difficulties showed up shortly after. The lack of time was an obvious factor, the need to respect the base material was another. How do you transpose characters, so far portrayed by text and drawings, into animated sprites? What fighting style should be given to each fighter? <em>\"All Tsukihime characters are supernatural beings, very powerful, and we had to reproduce this aspect in the game,\"&lt;\/em&gt; Narita explains.&lt;\/p&gt;<p><em>\"We put ourselves in the shoes of Tsukihime fans to imagine what kind of technique each character would use in a fight.

Meanwhile French Bread kept working on a sequel, and finally released it in 2004. MELTY BLOOD ReAct offered a more refined gameplay than the first version, greatly improving the game system and differentiating similar characters from each other. This version was made in collaboration with TYPE-MOON, now a company named Notes, which was this time even more involved in the making of the game's story, creating new characters and allowing the developer to use protagonists from their other series.&lt;\/p&gt;"},"id":"040a2ddb-8739-4297-a58b-dec01147030a","isHidden":false,"type":"imgleft"},{"content":{"text":"<p>2004 is also the year French Bread became a company and quit the doujin game scene. <em>\"The PC versions were still amateur games, but for the arcade release it was necessary to create a company and that's where Ecole Software fit into the loop,\"&lt;\/em&gt; tells Narita.&lt;\/p&gt;<p>This arcade version named Act Cadenza, co-funded by the arcade publisher Ecole Software, arrived in 2005 and was honored by a Playstation 2 release.

As such, Actress Again marked a milestone in the team\u2019s understanding of the genre.

It was time for a sequel! After all, the arrival of new home consoles and technological changes in the arcades (where games in 4\/3 on CRT screens were gradually replaced by LCD screens in 16\/9) left little room for a modest title like MELTY BLOOD.
